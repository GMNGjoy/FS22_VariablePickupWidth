# Variable Pickup Width
A new frontier in machinery enhancements has been achieved - the ability to alter the width of your pickup-related equipment from within the tractor, while on the go! Want just that little bit extra because you made monster windrows? _Bonus_ or _Enhanced_ mode is for you. Don't feel like windrowing at all today? the _Virtual Windrower_ setting is where it's at!

### From the ModDesc
> Have you ever wished that the pickup area was just a bit wider? Variable Pickup Width (VPW) is the solution for you!
>
> This mod adds a custom workMode to multiple types of basegame equipment that are designed to "pick up" something from the ground. Each tool has been updated to have a workMode that you can select while using the machine, allowing you to select from 4 different pickup widths:
> - Default Pickup (default)
> - Bonus Pickup (+2m)
> - Extended Pickup (+4m)
> - Virtual Windrower (20m)
>
> Balers:
> - Poettenger Impress 125F Pro VPW
> - Massey Ferguson 1840 VPW
> - Claas Quadrant 5300 HD VPW
> - Claas Rollant455 Uniwrap VPW
> - CaseIh LB436 HD VPW

> - CLAAS CARGOS 9500 VPW
>
> Pickup Headers:
> - Kemper N3003 VPW
>
> Stone Pickers:
> - Elho Scorpio 550 VPW
>
> Additionally, any VPW tool that also has a fill capacity will also have selectable capacity upgrades in the shop with relative discharge rates - but you'll have to pay for that extra capacity!
>
> Each item costs $1 more than basegame, works a bit faster and has full color selection.
