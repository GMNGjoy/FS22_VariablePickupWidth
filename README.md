# Forage Harvester Straw Pickup
Gameplay update to ForageHarvesters Pickup headers by creating a custom `FORAGEPICKUP` _fruitTypeCategory_ to allow straw to be picked up from basegame straw-producing fields (`WHEAT BARLEY OAT`), as well as crops producing straw from the [Extended Straw Crops](https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?lang=en&country=us&mod_id=253483&title=fs2022) mod (`CANOLA CORN SORGHUM SOYBEAN SUNFLOWER`)

- Customized basegame forage harvester headers with the new `FORAGEPICKUP` _fruitTypeCategory_ have been added to the store to enable the straw pickup functionality to be used - all headers are Giants assets with XML modifications.

- LUA script is used to force-load new _fruitTypes_ &amp; _fillTypes_, which is based off of a similar script from Jos Modding in the [Swathing Addon](https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?lang=en&country=sk&mod_id=267323). That code adapted to this purpose & used with permission.

**PC only** due to script usage.

## Description from the ModDesc
> Adds in the ability to pickup straw from fields that generate straw from 
the crop, to all basegame forage pickup headers.
> 
> All modified headers have color selection, slight speed increase, and slight working width increase.
Since the Forage Harvester is chopping the straw, you will also get a slight 10% increase in straw.
>

> - Claas PICKUP 300 +
> - Kemper 3003 +
> - John Deere Header 639 +
> - Krone EasyFlow 300 S +
